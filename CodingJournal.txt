Journal starts!

Till now:

1. HTML of the playing page

(1) Needed elements created

(2) Player name text box (Not working yet)

2. Basic CSS of the playing page

(1) Locations of the elements (P.S. Using "top, left, right, bottom", it can be crazy on different device)

(2) Z-indexing the elements (P.S. For the intro blacksheet on the first round)

(3) Size handling (P.S. Using "%" unit, it can be crazy on different device)

3. JS in seperated files

(1) Main script (Not cleaned yet)

a. Import all the files and call the functions only (Which I'm not done with)

b. Now I'm only finished with starting the script

c. Players will be created here, using variable with creating the class

(2) Player class

a. We'll give it a name when the player name text box is submitted

b. Their money will be saved in the class and we'll call it out when caculating (Not for showing)

(3) Picture handling (Not working yet)

a. Trying to change the picture when new actions happened 

b. I'm using the dictionary (Set a name and a value for it)

(4) Button handling

a. Betray button is  for adding 1 to p1 and subtracting 1 from p2 (Testing)

b. Cooperate button is for subtracting 1 from p1 and adding 1 to p2 (Testing)

c. I'll make the point system inside 

Experiences with AI (ChatGPT) :

I'm asking it about the property and the solution to
a problem, I'm trying to give it as little code as I 
can. By the way, I asked it to explain the code.

Problems now :

1. Can't give the name to the players correctly

2. Locations and sizes will be crazy on the moblie devices
